#JDK - Java Development Kit

* It is Used to compile the code.
* It converts the Java code into Byte code.
    - Byte code is just a set of instructions for JVM.
    - It lies between the low level language and high level language.
    - Byte code is platform dependent.
* Whenever we install JDK, JVM and JRE will be installed along with it.

#JVM - Java Virtual Machine

* JVM accepts the intermediate level language which are also called as ByteCode.
* This is responsible to run the compiled Byte code.
* JVM is platform dependent.
* It holds the local variables and partial results.
* When a method is invoked, a new frame is created. And for each thread creation, a new JVM stack is created.
  The created frame will be destroyed when the method invocation completes.
